## FERG package
### DALY Calculation Framework for WHO/FERG

The `FERG` package provides functions for calculating and reporting DALYs in the framework of WHO's [Foodborne Disease Burden Epidemiology Reference Group](http://www.who.int/entity/foodsafety/foodborne_disease/ferg/en/) work towards the global burden of foodborne disease. The DALY calculation framework of the FERG package is based on the [`DALY` package](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/DALY/index.html).

The functionalities of the `FERG` package are outlined in _Methodological Framework for World Health Organization Estimates of the Global Burden of Foodborne Disease_, currently under review by PLOS ONE. All FERG estimates will be published as part of a dedicated PLOS Collection, and officially launched at the [FERG Symposium](http://www.rivm.nl/en/Topics/F/Food_safety/Foodborne_diseases/FERG_symposium) in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, on 15-16 December 2015.
